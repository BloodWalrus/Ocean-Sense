The Mirror Camera tool can be used as a mirror for yourself, for example if you got something in your eye.

## Camera
A front camera preview is displayed with white bars around it (to provide light in dark environments). The preview shows a mirror image.

You can zoom by pinching the screen or by using the slider.
