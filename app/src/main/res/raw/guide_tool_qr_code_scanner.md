The QR Code Scanner tool can be used to scan QR codes.

- **Maps**: Open the location in a map app on your phone.
- **Copy**: Copy the contents of the QR code to your clipboard.
- **Delete**: Remove the result from the list.

### URL
If the QR code contains a URL, you will have the following options:
- **Open**: Open the URL in your default browser.

- **Delete**: Remove the result from the list.

### Text
If the QR code contains text or is an unsupported type, you will have the following options:
- **Note**: Create a note with the text. This will create a note and display a banner at the bottom of the screen with a button to access the note.
- **Copy**: Copy the contents of the QR code to your clipboard.
- **Delete**: Remove the result from the list.
