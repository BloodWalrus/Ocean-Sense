The Battery tool can be used to monitor battery consumption.

## Time until charged / dead
The Battery tool will provide an estimate (based on the last day's history) of how long it will take for your phone to die or become fully charged. The actual time may vary with use.

## Battery statistics
The battery indicator shows the current battery percentage and, if supported, the remaining capacity (in mAh). Below that, you can see how fast your device is currently charging or discharging. Additionally, if your battery health is poor, you will see a warning.

## Battery history
You can view the history of battery percentage by clicking the chart icon in the top-right corner. This displays the last day's history, as recorded by Ocean Sense.

The history is updated about every hour, you can disable this in 'Settings > Battery > Battery log'. If this is disabled, you will no longer see battery history and may not see time until full or empty.

## System settings
To access system battery settings and usage, click the settings icon in the top-right corner.

## Power saving mode
By turning on 'Power saving mode', you can reduce the power consumption of Ocean Sense by stopping some services, such as Backtrack and Weather, as well as using the black theme. You can activate this by using the 'Power saving mode' switch on the battery tool.

You can configure power saving mode to activate automatically when your battery is low by enabling 'Settings > Battery > Automatic power saving'.

## Services
Running services are listed below the battery statistics. You can see how often they are running and how much impact they have on battery life. You can stop a service by clicking the 'X' button next to it.

## Quick action
You can enable the Power Saving Mode quick action in the settings for the tab you want it on.

To use the quick action, tap the power saving mode quick action button to toggle it on or off.

## Additional tips
- Enable your phone's battery saver mode.
- Reduce screen brightness.
- Turn on airplane mode (you won't be able to receive calls/texts).
- Turn off your screen when not in use.
