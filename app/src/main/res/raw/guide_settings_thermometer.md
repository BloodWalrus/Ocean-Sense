Thermometer settings can be found in Trail Sense Settings > Sensors > Thermometer.

## Source
On most phones, you should use this historic temperature source as it will be more accurate.

- **Historic** temperature is estimated from 30 years of historical data. It's usually accurate, but not during extreme weather. You can calibrate it if it's wrong for your location.
- **Sensor** temperature is read from the phone's built-in thermometer. It's often inaccurate because it's affected by the phone's CPU and battery. You can calibrate it to improve its accuracy. If you power off your phone for a while, you will get a more accurate reading from the sensor.

## Smoothing
To reduce noise in temperature readings, you can increase the smoothing setting. If using the historic temperature source, this is normally not needed.

If the Weather Monitor (see the Weather tool) is enabled, you will see a chart of the temperature history as recorded by your device. The colored line represents the calibrated temperature while the gray line represents the raw temperature. When you adjust the settings, the chart will update to show the new calibrated temperature. The goal is to have the colored line smoothly follow the gray line.

### Updating recorded temperatures

If you change the temperature source to "Historic", you can choose to update all previously recorded temperatures. This will replace the old temperatures with the estimated temperature from the historic data. This is useful if you previously recorded temperatures with the sensor and then switched to historic temperatures.

## Calibrating

1. Reset the thermometer calibration in Trail Sense.
2. Put your phone in a cold place for 10 minutes.
3. Note the temperature shown in Trail Sense as the minimum phone temperature.
4. Note the actual temperature of the cold place using an actual thermometer.
5. Put your phone in a warm place for 10 minutes.
6. Note the temperature shown in Trail Sense as the maximum phone temperature.
7. Note the actual temperature of the warm place using an actual thermometer.
8. Go to the Thermometer sensor settings in Trail Sense and enter the minimum and maximum temperatures you recorded, along with the actual temperatures you recorded.

**Caution:** Refer to your phone's manual to identify the designed operating temperatures, do not exceed these when performing calibration.
