「天文」工具可以用於查看太陽或月亮何時升起。它也可以用來了解天文事件何時發生，例如流星雨或月食。

除距離日出或日落時間（始終是今天）外，頁面上顯示的所有資訊均適用於所選擇的日期。預設情況下已選擇為今天，但是你可以透過點擊螢幕頂部的日曆圖示來更改它。此外，你可以使用箭頭移至下一個／上一個日期，或長按日曆以快速跳到今天的日期。

你也可以點擊搜尋圖示來尋找你所在位置下一次發生的天文事件，例如下一次滿月或流星雨。

## 距離日出／日落時間

距離日出或日落的時間顯示在螢幕頂部。這遵循「設定」>「天文」中的「日出／日落時間」。有關每個時間的描述，請參閱下面的「太陽」章節。

## 圖表
The chart shows the position of the sun and moon throughout the day. The X-axis is time, and the Y-axis is the altitude or height in the sky. You can tap on the sun or moon icon in the chart to see its current position. When you do this, a slider will appear so you can see its position at a different time of the day.

You can also choose to keep the current time centered in the chart by enabling 'Keep sun/moon centered' in Settings > Astronomy. This will keep the current time centered in the chart when you have today selected and will show 12 hours before and after the current time. If you have a different date selected, it will show the entire day instead.

## 太陽
All times related to the sun respect the 'Sunrise/sunset times' in Settings > Astronomy. For a description of each time, see below.

The time until sunrise or sunset is shown at the top of the screen.

The time of sunrise, sunset, and noon is shown below the chart, as well as the length of the day. If you tap this section, you will see more details about the sun for the current day:

- **Actual**: This is the actual time of sunrise, sunset, and noon. It is the time when the sun is at the horizon.
- **Civil**: This is the time of sunrise, sunset, and noon when the sun is between 0 and 6 degrees below the horizon. There is enough light to see objects clearly.
- **Nautical**: This is the time of sunrise, sunset, and noon when the sun is between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon. The horizon is still visible, but it is too dark to see objects clearly.
- **Astronomical**: This is the time of sunrise, sunset, and noon when the sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon. It is completely dark, but it is perfect for stargazing.
- **Peak altitude**: This is the highest point the sun reaches in the sky. It is shown in degrees above the horizon.
- **Daylight**: This is the amount of time when the sun is up.
- **Night**: This is the amount of time when the sun is down.
- **Season**: This is the astronomical season based on the Earth's position around the sun. It will be one of the following: spring, summer, fall, or winter.
- **Altitude**: This is the current angle of the sun above the horizon. It is shown in degrees.
- **Direction**: This is the current direction the sun is in. It is shown in degrees.

## 月亮
The time of moonrise, moonset, and lunar noon are shown below the chart, as well as the current moon phase and illumination percentage. If you tap this section, you will see more details about the moon for the current day:

- **Times**: This is the time of moonrise, moonset, and lunar noon.
- **Moon phase**: This is the current phase of the moon as it appears in the sky.
- **Illumination**: This is the percentage of the moon that is illuminated. A full moon is 100% illuminated, and a new moon is 0% illuminated.
- **Peak altitude**: This is the highest point the moon reaches in the sky. It is shown in degrees above the horizon.
- **Supermoon**: This is when the moon is closer to the Earth than normal, making it appear larger and brighter in the sky.

## 流星雨
If a meteor shower peak is happening on the selected date at your location, it will show in the list. It displays the start, peak, and end times of the shower, as well as the average number of meteors per hour. You can tap on the shower to see more details:

- **Times**: This is the start, peak, and end times of the shower.
- **Name**: This is the name of the shower.
- **Rate**: This is the average number of meteors per hour.
- **Peak altitude**: This is the highest point the radiant (area where the meteors appear to come from) reaches in the sky. It is shown in degrees above the horizon.
- **Peak direction**: This is the direction the radiant is in.

## 月食
If a lunar eclipse is happening on the selected date at your location, it will show in the list. It displays the start, peak, and end times of the eclipse, as well as how much of the moon is eclipsed. You can tap on the eclipse to see more details:

- **Times**: This is the start, peak, and end times of the eclipse.
- **Duration**: This is the duration of the eclipse.
- **Obscuration**: This is the percentage of the moon that is eclipsed.
- **Magnitude**: This is the magnitude of the eclipse. It is the fraction of the moon's diameter that is eclipsed.
- **Peak altitude**: This is the altitude of the moon at the peak of the eclipse. It is shown in degrees above the horizon.
- **Peak direction**: This is the direction the moon is in at the peak of the eclipse.

## 日食
If a solar eclipse is happening on the selected date at your location, it will show in the list. It displays the start, peak, and end times of the eclipse, as well as how much of the sun is eclipsed. You can tap on the eclipse to see more details:

- **Times**: This is the start, peak, and end times of the eclipse.
- **Duration**: This is the duration of the eclipse.
- **Obscuration**: This is the percentage of the sun that is eclipsed.
- **Magnitude**: This is the magnitude of the eclipse. It is the fraction of the sun's diameter that is eclipsed.
- **Peak altitude**: This is the altitude of the sun at the peak of the eclipse, shown in degrees above the horizon.
- **Peak direction**: This is the direction the sun is in at the peak of the eclipse.

## 日落警報
Alerts can be set for sunset to avoid being caught outside in the dark. To set an alert, open Settings > Astronomy and enable 'Sunset alerts'. You can adjust the 'Sunset alert time' setting to determine how far in advance you want to be notified. There is also a quick action available for the sunset alert. See below for more information.

## 天文警報
Alerts can be set for astronomical events to ensure you don't miss them. To set an alert, open Settings > Astronomy and enable the alerts you want to be notified about for your location. You can receive notifications for meteor showers, lunar eclipses, and solar eclipses. The alert will be shown up to 24 hours in advance of the event start time.

## 3D 檢視
If your phone has a compass, you will see a "View in 3D" button. Clicking this will open the Augmented Reality tool with the selected date and allow you to see where the sun and moon will be throughout the day using your camera.

You can choose to disable the camera when clicked by disabling the "Settings > Astronomy > Use camera for 3D viewing" setting.

## 快速動作
You can enable the Sunset Alert quick action in the settings for the tab where you want it to appear.

To use the quick action, tap the sunset alert quick action button to toggle it on or off.
