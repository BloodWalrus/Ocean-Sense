The barometer is used to measure air pressure. It can be used to predict the weather or determine your altitude. To adjust barometer settings, go to Trail Sense Settings > Sensors > Barometer.

If you have the Weather Monitor (see the Weather tool) enabled, you will see a chart of the barometric pressure history as recorded by your device. The colored line represents the calibrated pressure while the gray line represents the raw pressure. When you adjust the settings, the chart will update to show the new calibrated pressure. The goal is to have the colored line smoothly follow the gray line.

## Sea level pressure
Barometric pressure changes with altitude, which makes it difficult to compare pressure readings from different locations. To make pressure readings more consistent, enable the "Sea level pressure" setting. This will adjust the pressure reading to what it would be at sea level. Using this setting will increase the accuracy of weather predictions.

## Smoothing
To reduce noise in pressure readings, increase the smoothing setting. A value of around 15% is recommended. However, if you increase the smoothing too much, Trail Sense may ignore real pressure changes.

## Factor in temperature
To get a more accurate pressure reading, you can factor in the temperature. This will make the reading more prone to noise from your phone's thermometer, but it will also give you a more accurate reading of the actual air pressure.
