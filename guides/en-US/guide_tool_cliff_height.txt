The Cliff Height tool can be used to estimate the height of a cliff.

## Estimating height
1. Ensure the area below the cliff is safe (no risk of landslides or people/animals).
2. Drop a small rock or similar object down the cliff while holding the measure button.
3. Release the button when the object hits the bottom.
4. The height of the cliff will be displayed at the top of the screen.

## Disclaimer
You are responsible for ensuring that you use this tool in a safe manner. Please only use it when it is safe to do so, and do not stand too close to the cliff.
