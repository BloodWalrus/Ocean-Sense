## Adding items

With a packing list open, click the '+' button in the bottom-right corner. On the create item screen, fill out the fields as described below:

## Marking items as packed
If you've packed an item, you can either edit it or click the checkbox next to it to mark it as packed. This will set the packed amount to the desired amount and update the weight (if applicable).

## Pack weight
If the items have weight associated with them, the total weight of the pack will be displayed at the top of the screen. The units of the total weight can be changed in Settings > Units > Weight.

## Sorting a packing list

Clicking the menu on the top-right of the packing list will allow you to sort your items.

- **Category**: This groups items by category and sorts them by name within the category.
- **Percent packed (low to high)**: Items which are unpacked show at the top, while packed items move to the bottom. Use this to more easily see what is left to pack.
- **Percent packed (high to low)**: Items which are packed show at the top, while unpacked items move to the bottom. Use this to more easily see what is already packed.
- **Weight (low to high)**: Items which take up less weight in your pack sort to the top.
- **Weight (high to low)**: Items which take up more weight in your pack sort to the top. Use this to see which items are weighing down your pack.
