The Bubble Level tool can be used to determine if a surface is flat. This can be helpful for setting up a tent or a cooking stove.

## Determine if a surface is flat
To determine if a surface is flat:

1. Place the device flat on the surface.
2. Wait for the bubble level to settle.
3. If the bubble is centered, the surface is flat. If the bubble is to the left of the screen, the surface is higher on the left side. If the bubble is at the top of the screen, the surface is higher on the top side.

The exact angle of the surface in degrees on the X (left/right) and Y (top/bottom) axis is displayed at the top.

It is also possible to hold the device on its side to measure an angle and use the Y axis to measure the angle.
