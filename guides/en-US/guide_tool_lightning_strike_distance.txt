The Lightning Strike Distance tool calculates how far away a lightning strike is. This helps you determine if a storm is approaching or moving away.

## Measuring distance
To use:

1. Press the lightning icon immediately after seeing lightning.
2. Press the thunder icon immediately after hearing thunder.
3. The distance to the strike will be displayed at the top of the screen.

If lightning is close enough to be dangerous, you will see a warning.

The bottom of the screen shows the distance to the most recent strike. If the current strike distance is less than the previous one, the storm is likely approaching. If it is greater, the storm is likely moving away.
